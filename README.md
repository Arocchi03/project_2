Topic/Rationale: Visualize a dashboard of Chicago AirBnb data with filters by neighborhood, including various metrics such as: avg rental price, avg availability, top 10 rated Airbnbs, as well as layering on crime data. Interactivity will consist of toggling between neighborhoods that filter the dashboard data.

Day one, data selection and project proposal. Once the data was uploaded we started the data cleanup procedure where we eliminated any redundancies, filtered the data, and changed the columns names. We then loaded in the data in SQL/ Sqlite. At the very same time we started building the HTML template. We created the flask connection and got started on our JS library. Lastly, we tested the template and made any and all nessecary adjustments.
